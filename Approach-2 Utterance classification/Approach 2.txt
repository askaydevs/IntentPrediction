Approach: 

1)parse the text based on context change. the different contexts can be  product,quantity,price,place, advance.
  for parsing each sentence is classifed as the following standard utterances as used in few research papers:
   -gg:greeting
   -q:question
   -pa:potential answer
   -pf:positive feedback
   -nf:negative feedback
   -fd:further details
   -fq :follow up question
     -jnk
two more categories I think we should be adding to deal with negotiations: 
                                   -request
                                   -response
2)Further classify the subentities detected from each parsed entity into the two products.

2 Okay,                                            :product+pf
\end
                       
sub entities detected:
product: iphone, headphone

5 Sure                                            :place +pf
\end

\start                                
6 It will cost you 30k each for iPhones and 1500 for headphones :price +fd
7 Headphones are costly.                        :price                               
8 Give it to me for 1000 each                   :price req
9 1200 is the last price i can give you.    :  price response               
10 Okay ,                                   :price pf
\end



sub entities detected:
price : 30k ,1500,1000 ,1200 
            
        further: classify 30k as iphone and 1500,1000,1200 as headphones cost
since final msg in thread is of positive feedback,final price is 1200

 but at-least give me some overall discount                             :discount request

sub entities detected:
